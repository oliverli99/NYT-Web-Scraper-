    "The underlying structure of how this scraper works is by using a bunch of lists. Each list should contain around 52 items, \n",
    "with each item being a state. Each list is a column in the dataframe. The scraper takes advantage of the dataframe structure to fill in 1 or 0's if that specific state meets varying hard-coded conditions. The final CSV contains each state, what has industries/businesses have reopened in that state, respective political party and governor, and COVID-19 data. The main purpose of this mini-project is to understand re-opening policies, find patterns, and conduct risk assessments on existing financial customers.   "
